India won the toss and elected to field first against Australia at the Rajiv Gandhi Worldwide Arena in Hyderabad. India introduced one tweak in the playing XI, Bhuvneshwar Kumar came in for Rishabh Gasp. The visitors also made one improvement to their playing XI, with Josh Inglis replacing Sean Abbott.
Cameron Green gave Australia a positive start as he smashed 37 runs in the opening three overs. Axar Patel gave India a vital leap forward when he got the wicket of Aaron Finch at 7(6). Green reached his 19-ball 50 in the fifth over. Bhuvneshwar gave India a much-needed leap forward when he dismissed Green at 52(21).
The Indian bowlers worked really hard through the center overs of the innings. Chahal excused Steven Smith on 9(10) and Glenn Maxwell was chased by an immediate hit from Axar Patel.
Axar Patel also got the wicket of Josh Inglis and Matthew Swim in his last over. He excused Inglis at 24(22) and Swim at 1(3). At one point, Australia were struggling to reach 170 runs, but Tim David's 50-run checker and a 68-run stand between David and Sams helped Australia post 186 in a sudden surge in demand on the scoreboard.
India did not start their innings well as Sams got the wicket of KL Rahul in the first over. Pat Cummins excused Rohit Sharma on 17(14). Virat Kohli and Suryakumar were generally crushing the Australian bowlers down the ground. Suryakumar scored his 50 in 29 balls. At that point he hit two or three sixes and four of his next five balls before getting to Hazlewood's over.
Kohli reached his 33rd T20I 50. Sams excused him in the follow-on at 63(48), but an unbeaten Hardik Pandya with 25 off 16 helped India dominate the game by six wickets.
